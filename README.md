# IE 5331: Introduction to Quantum Information and Computation

This repository contains learning materials and assignments (in qiskit) that I created/curated as I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the graduate level IE 5331 course. This resource covers the following topics:

    - Basic qiskit API explanation 

    - Single Qubit systems

    - Statevector Evolution

    - Multiple qubit states, superposition and entanglement

    - QML Model

    - Quantum Teleporation

    - Deutsch Algorithm

    -  Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm 

        - Application in finance

    - Launching jobs on IBM Hardware

    - Grover's Algorithm

    - Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm

## Primer to Quantum Information and Computation

My take on introducing QIC - [primer.pdf](primer.pdf).

## Instructions on how to install Qiskit and other required technology

Please follow this document - [install_qiskit.pdf](tutorial_1.pdf).

## Acknowledgement
These materials were highly influenced from previous work done by [IBM Qiskit](https://qiskit.org) team and the wonderful community built around this tool.
